<p>But the cities visited by Marco Polo were always different from those thought of by the emperor.</p>
<p>‘And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced,’ Kublai said. ‘It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations.’</p>
<p>‘I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others’ Marco answered, ‘It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.’</p>
