<p>KUBLAI Unless toil, shouts, sores, stink do not exist; and only this azalea bush._</p>
<p>POLO Unless porters, stonecutters, rubbish collectors, cooks cleaning the lights of chickens, washerwomen bent over stones, mothers stirring rice as they nurse their infants, exist only because we think them._</p>
<p>KUBLAI To tell the truth, I never think them._</p>
<p>POLO Then they do not exist._</p>
<p>KUBLAI To me this conjecture does not seem to suit our purposes. Without them we could never remain here swaying, cocooned in our hammocks._</p>
<p>POLO Then the hypothesis must be rejected. So the other hypothesis is true: they exist and we do not._</p>
<p>KUBLAI We have proved that if we were here, we would not be._</p>
<p>POLO And here, in fact, we are.</p>
