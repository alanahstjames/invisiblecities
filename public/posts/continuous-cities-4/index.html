I will answer you with a story.</p>
<p>In the streets of Cecilia, an illustrious city, I met once a goatherd, driving a tinkling flock along the walls.</p>
<p>‘Man blessed by heaven,’ he asked me, stopping, ‘can you tell me the name of the city in which we are?’</p>
<p>‘May the gods accompany you!’ I cried. ‘How can you fail to recognize the illustrious city of Cecilia?’</p>
<p>‘Bear with me,’ that man answered. ‘I am a wandering herdsman. Sometimes my goats and I have to pass through cities; but we are unable to distinguish them. Ask me the names of the grazing lands: I know them all, the Meadow between the Cliffs, the Green Slope, the Shadowed Grass. Cities have no name for me: they are places without leaves, separating one pasture from another, and where the goats are frightened at street corners and scatter. The dog and I run to keep the flock together.’</p>
<p>‘I am the opposite of you,’ I said. ‘I recognize only cities and cannot distinguish what is outside them. In uninhabited places each stone and each clump of grass mingles, in my eyes, with every other stone and clump.’</p>
<p>Many years have gone by since then; I have known many more cities and I have crossed continents. One day I was walking among rows of identical houses; I was lost. I asked a passerby: ‘May the immortals protect you, can you tell me where we are?’</p>
<p>‘In Cecilia, worse luck!’ he answered. ‘We have been wandering through its streets, my goats and I, for an age, and we cannot find our way out…’</p>
<p>I recognized him, despite his long white beard; it was the same herdsman of long before. He was followed by a few, mangy goats, which did not even stink, they were so reduced to skin-and-bones. They cropped wastepaper in the rubbish bins.</p>
<p>‘That cannot be!’ I shouted. ‘I, too, entered a city, I cannot remember when, and since then I have gone on, deeper and deeper into its streets. But how have I managed to arrive where you say, when I was in another city, far far away from Cecilia, and I have not yet left it?’</p>
<p>‘The places have mingled,’ the goatherd said. ‘Cecilia is everywhere. Here, once upon a time, there must have been the Meadow of the Low Sage. My goats recognize the grass on the traffic island.’</p>
