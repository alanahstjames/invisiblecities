POLO … Perhaps the terraces of this garden overlook only the lake of our mind…_

KUBLAI … and however far our troubled enterprises as warriors and merchants may take us, we both harbour within ourselves this silent shade, this conversation of pauses, this evening that is always the same._

POLO Unless the opposite hypothesis is correct: that those who strive in camps and ports exist only because we two think of them, here, enclosed among these bamboo hedges, motionless since time began._

KUBLAI Unless toil, shouts, sores, stink do not exist; and only this azalea bush._

POLO Unless porters, stonecutters, rubbish collectors, cooks cleaning the lights of chickens, washerwomen bent over stones, mothers stirring rice as they nurse their infants, exist only because we think them._

KUBLAI To tell the truth, I never think them._

POLO Then they do not exist._

KUBLAI To me this conjecture does not seem to suit our purposes. Without them we could never remain here swaying, cocooned in our hammocks._

POLO Then the hypothesis must be rejected. So the other hypothesis is true: they exist and we do not._

KUBLAI We have proved that if we were here, we would not be._

POLO And here, in fact, we are.
