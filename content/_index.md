Welcome to this collobration between Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities* and AI art. 

While there is a thin plot running through *Invisible Cities*, you can choose to read about the cities in any order. Just click one of the chapters to get started.

See the [About](/about) page for some information about the book and how we created the art.
