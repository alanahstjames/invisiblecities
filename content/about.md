*Invisible Cities*, written by Italo Calvino, is a postmodern novel published in 1972 by Giulio Einaudi Editore.

The book is framed as a conversation between the Mongol emperor, Kublai Khan, and Marco Polo. The majority of the book consists of brief prose poems describing 55 fictitious cities that are narrated by Polo, many of which can be read as commentary on culture, language, time, memory, death, or human experience generally.

When we (Kieren and Alanah) read the novel in December 2024, our minds were filled with visions of the cities that Marco Polo described. To bring these visions to life, we fed each chapter of the book to ChatGPT 4o and told it to create an image for each city. This website serves as a place to read Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities*, alongside these AI-generate images. 

Each reader's vision of a city will be different, and we encourage everyone to submit their artistic depiction of a city, AI-generated or otherwise, on our [Submissions](/submissions) page.
